# channel-estimation-using-deep-learning
Channel estimation for high speed trains , using OFDM and deep learning models like FSRCNN and DNCNN
Develop a deep learning approach for channel estimation inhigh-mobility scenarios like high-speed railways using areconstruction and recovery network model.Model will improve the accuracy and efficiency of channel estimation under non-stationary and fast time-varying wireless channel conditions.
